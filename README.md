# EDUGAIN

EDUgain is an android app which is useful for students as well as faculty members and other academic staff. This is an app based on course management system. In paper-based systems all of the work is done manually, which is time consuming. Due to this we are developing an android application where time can be saved. Through our application, students can search their results using Android mobile. All information is stored in a backend server. The faculty member is authorized to log into EDUgain through user id and password and they can enter the studentâ€™s information like attendance, grades, etc. The key idea is to implement an android project using Java with the help of backend server where entire data is stored. For everyone there is separate login and password which can be used for logging. There are many functionalities that are included in the app such as attendance, grades, reports, class schedule, faculty and student details. Faculty can view their reports easily whenever they want. This app utilizes three modules:
Student: This module can view their grades, attendance, and class schedule.
Faculty: They enter grades and attendance using this module.
Admin: Handles all academic details like updating courses, student information, viewing reports, editing reports, etc.
